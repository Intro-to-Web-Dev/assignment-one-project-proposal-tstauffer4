     <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
     <h4>The mission of this site is to provide golfers with a new interactive and informative experience to help plan golf trips, connect with the community, and improve skills.</h4> 
     <h2>3 Goals</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>Help plan golf outings</li>
         <li>Expose more people to the game of golf</li>
         <li>Provide tips and tricks to help people sharpen their skills</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Model Site</h2>
        <p>The website I chose to model my site after is tripadvisor.com. I thought Trip Advisor would be a good site to pick because their objective is similar to mine. Instead of vacation planning, my site assists with golf outing planning.</p>
